{{#title Learn Embedded Rust with ESP32 IoT Projects | impl Rust for ESP32}}

# Intro

In this book, we use the ESP32 DevKit v1 with Rust to build simple and fun projects. The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller for IoT applications, and we take a hands-on approach to help you learn by doing. You will explore how to turn on an LED when the room gets darker using an LDR, use an ultrasonic sensor to detect when something is close, control an LED through Wi-Fi, draw images/text on an OLED display, play songs and alarm sound with a buzzer, control a servo motor, and more.

We'll use Rust's `no_std` environment. While it's possible to program the ESP32 in a std environment, I feel it's better to start with no_std, as it enables you to apply the same logic when working with other microcontrollers.

## Prerequisites
If you haven't already read the ["The Rust on ESP Book"](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/book/), I highly recommend doing so first. While this book will cover some aspects of setting up the development environment and basic concepts, it will not go into as much detail to avoid unnecessary repetition, as these topics are already thoroughly explained in the official book.

I also recommend you to read ["The Embedded Rust book"](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/index.html) - An introductory book about using the Rust on "Bare Metal" embedded systems.

## Meet the Hardware
We will be using one of the development board "ESP32 DevKit V1", which comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, along with an integrated RF module

## Datasheets
For detailed technical information, specifications, and guidelines, refer to the official datasheets:
- [ESP32 Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf)
- [Technical Reference Manual](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf)
- [ESP32-WROOM-32 Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32_datasheet_en.pdf)

## Breadboard
The ESP32 devkit is slightly wider than usual. If you use a standard breadboard, you might struggle to fit the board, as I did. To solve this, I bought two mini breadboards, placed the ESP32 between them, and connected each side.

In the picture, the bottom section shows how I connected the ESP32 to the two breadboards. The top section just displays the breadboards before any connections were made.
