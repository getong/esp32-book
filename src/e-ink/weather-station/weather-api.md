# Weather API

In this chapter, we'll learn how to send a request to the API and deserialize the JSON response into a struct.

I hope you have obtained API key for the openweathermap website. We can pass it through environment variable. So we define constant like this

```rust
const API_KEY: &str = env!("API_KEY");
```

## JSON to Struct

I want you to go through the API documentation at "https://openweathermap.org/current" and familiarize yourself with the JSON response structure. At the top level, I defined a WeatherData struct with fields like weather, main, and wind, each using custom struct types. To avoid cluttering the tutorial, I'll include the definitions of other structs at the end of the chapter.


```rust
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct WeatherData {
    pub weather: Vec<Weather, 4>,
    pub main: Main,
    pub wind: Wind,
    #[serde(with = "chrono::serde::ts_seconds")]
    pub dt: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub name: String<20>,
}
```
Here, I'm only deserializing the fields we need and ignoring the rest of the JSON data.
 
## Weather API

Let's create a wrapper struct to handle API requests. While a simple function could work, it would require passing the URL and Wi-Fi stack every time. By using a struct, we can instantiate it once and call the access_website method whenever we need the latest weather data.

```rust
pub struct WeatherApi {
    wifi: Stack<'static>,
    url: String<120>,
    tls_seed: u64,
}
```

In the new function, we'll construct the API URL by appending the API key and store it in the field.

NOTE: If you observed, I have used "London" as the city name. You can replace it with your city name along with the country code. Refer to the doc for more details and adjust accordingly.

```rust
pub fn new(wifi: Stack<'static>, tls_seed: u64) -> Self {
    let mut url = String::new();
    url.push_str(
        "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&units=metric&appid=",
    )
    .unwrap();
    url.push_str(API_KEY).unwrap();
    Self {
        wifi,
        url,
        tls_seed,
    }
}
```

## Sending API Request

Next, we'll instantiate the DNS socket and TCP client. With the basic setup in place, we'll pass the TCP client, DNS socket, and TLS configuration to the HttpClient, and use it to send a request to the API URL. Once we receive the response, we'll deserialize the JSON payload into a WeatherData struct using serde_json_core.

```rust
pub async fn access_website(&self) -> WeatherData {
    let mut rx_buffer = [0; 4096 * 2];
    let mut tx_buffer = [0; 4096 * 2];

    let tls_config = TlsConfig::new(
        self.tls_seed,
        &mut rx_buffer,
        &mut tx_buffer,
        reqwless::client::TlsVerify::None,
    );

    let dns = DnsSocket::new(self.wifi);
    let tcp_state = TcpClientState::<1, 4096, 4096>::new();
    let tcp = TcpClient::new(self.wifi, &tcp_state);

    let mut client = HttpClient::new_with_tls(&tcp, &dns, tls_config);
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 4096];
    let mut http_req = client
        .request(reqwless::request::Method::GET, &self.url)
        .await
        .unwrap();
    let response = http_req.send(&mut buffer).await.unwrap();

    info!("Got response");
    let res = response.body().read_to_end().await.unwrap();

    let (data, _): (WeatherData, _) = serde_json_core::de::from_slice(res).unwrap();
    data
}
```

## The rest of the struct

One thing to note here: the API gives the weather condition as a number (it also provides it as a string, but the number is easier to work with). We'll map those numbers to our ConditionCode enum. We've also added an icon function to that enum, which tells us which icon to show for each specific weather condition.
