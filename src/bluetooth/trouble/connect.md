# Connecting to Our BLE Server Using nRF Connect Mobile App

Once you flash the code to the ESP32, open the nRF Connect mobile app. 

Scan for the Bluetooth name we set (mine is "implRust") and connect to it. 

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="BLE nRF Connect mobile" src="./images/ble-scan-and-connect-with-nrf-connect.jpg"/>

The app will show the supported service and characteristics. Tap the down arrow under a characteristic to read data and the up arrow to write data. If you send(i.e write) data, you will see it in the system console.

Tap the icon with three down arrow under a characteristic to subscribe for the notification and observe the value change.

## Clone the existing project
You can clone (or refer) project I created and navigate to the `bluetooth-low-energy` folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ImplFerris/esp32-projects
cd esp32-projects/bluetooth-low-energy/
```
