The above pinout diagram is derivative from the original diagram created by the CircuitState website. They also have provided detailed explanations for each pin.

## Keypoints

- **Input-Only GPIOs:** GPIO pins 34, 35, 36, and 39 are input-only and cannot be used as output pins. In the pinout diagram, these pins are labeled with a "GPIX" prefix and marked with an "X" to indicate output is not allowed. Whenever possible, prefer using the pins highlighted in purple on the diagram.

- **Flashing and Debugging:** GPIO 1 (Tx) and GPIO 3 (Rx) are designated for flashing and debugging purposes.

- **ADC Pins:** Pins labeled as `ADC1_[Number]` are associated with ADC1, while those labeled as `ADC2_[Number]` are associated with ADC2.
