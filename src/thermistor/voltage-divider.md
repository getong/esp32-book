# NTC and Voltage Divider

I have created a circuit on the Falstad website, and you can download the [voltage-divider-thermistor.circuitjs.txt](./voltage-divider-thermistor.circuitjs.txt) file to import and experiment with.   This setup is similar to what we covered in the [Voltage divider](../core-concepts/voltage-divider.md) chapter. If you haven't gone through that section, I highly recommend completing the theory there before continuing.

This circuit includes a 10kΩ thermistor(R2) with a resistance of 10kΩ at 25°C. The input voltage \\( V_{in} \\) is set to 3.3V. 

**Note:** When you create this voltage divider with the microcontroller, the ADC peripheral will convert the Vout to a digital value.


### Themistor at 25°C
The thermistor has a resistance of 10kΩ at 25°C, resulting in an output voltage (\\( V_{out} \\)) of 1.65V.

## Thermistor at 38°C
The thermistor's resistance decreases due to its negative temperature coefficient, altering the voltage divider's output.

## Thermistor at 10°C
The thermistor's resistance increases, resulting in a higher output voltage (\\( V_{out} \\)).

These are for illustration purposes only; measurements in your thermistor may not be exactly the same.
