# Help & Troubleshooting

If you face any bugs, errors, or other issues while working on the exercises, here are a few ways to troubleshoot and resolve them.

## 1. Compare with Working Code

Check the complete code examples or clone the reference project for comparison. Carefully review your code and `Cargo.toml` dependency versions. Look out for any syntax or logic errors. If a required feature is not enabled or there is a feature mismatch, make sure to enable the correct features as shown in the exercise. 

If you find a version mismatch, either adjust your code(research and find a solution; it's a great way for you to learn and understand things better) to work with the newer version or update the dependencies to match the versions used in the tutorial.

## 2. Search or Report GitHub Issues

Visit the GitHub issues page to see if someone else has encountered the same problem:
[https://github.com/ImplFerris/esp32-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue](https://github.com/ImplFerris/esp32-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue)

If not, you can raise a new issue and describe your problem clearly.

## 3. Ask the Community

The Rust Embedded community is active in the Matrix Chat. The Matrix chat is an open network for secure, decentralized communication.

Here are some useful Matrix channels related to topics covered in this book:

- **Embedded Devices Working Group**  
  [`#rust-embedded:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#rust-embedded:matrix.org)  
  General discussions around using Rust for embedded development.

- **ESP32 Development**  
  [`#esp-rs:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#esp-rs:matrix.org)  
  Focused on Rust development for the ESP32 family of chips.

- **Debugging with Probe-rs**  
  [`#probe-rs:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org)  
  For support and discussion around the [probe-rs](https://probe.rs) debugging toolkit.

- **Embedded Graphics**  
  [`#rust-embedded-graphics:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#rust-embedded-graphics:matrix.org)  
  For working with [`embedded-graphics`](https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics), a drawing library for embedded systems.

You can create a Matrix account and join these channels to get help from experienced developers.

You can find more community chat rooms in the [Awesome Embedded Rust - Community Chat Rooms section](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust?tab=readme-ov-file#community-chat-rooms).


## 4. Discord

There is an unofficial Discord community for Embedded Rust where you can ask questions, discuss topics, share your experiences, and showcase your projects. It is especially useful for learners and general discussion.

Keep in mind that most HAL and embedded ecosystem maintainers are more active on Matrix. Still, this Discord server can be a good place to learn and interact with others.
